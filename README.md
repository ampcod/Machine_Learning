Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to theirmeasurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and _here the task was to train a machine learning model that can learn from themeasurements of the iris species and classify them_.

**Dataset Used**-The Iris Dataset

## Task 2-Unemployment Analysis with Python
We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.
In this task I perform exploratory data analysis(EDA) on the dataset to analyzing and visualizing data to understand its key characteristics, uncover patterns, and identify relationships between variables.
